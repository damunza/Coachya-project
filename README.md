## Description
In the app, users are first required to register their personal profiles. After the registration of their profiles, they are then allowed to register their teams by listing down their team members, team contact details, team name, the type of assistance they need, and their location. Similarly, coaches also fill their Coach profiles. The coaches are then able to see the list of teams that need assistance. They are then able to contact the team members by sending them a message, offering to support them. The coaches are also able to access the team's email address. Once the coach and team agree on how they can work, they can then proceed to work together.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
1. Load the app on any web browser such as Chrome, Mozilla, or Internet Explorer.
2. For coaches, Sign up or login to the app to view the list of teams that need assistance, and send them messages.
3. For teams, Sign up or login to the app and fill your team members and other details. The coaches will then be able to contact you after seeing your details.
